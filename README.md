K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
ðŸ“Œ Objective

The goal of this task is to implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using Scikit-learn.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Matplotlib

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Iris Dataset (famous multi-class dataset with flower features)

Features are normalized before applying KNN to ensure fair distance calculations.

ðŸš€ Steps Followed

Loaded the Iris dataset from sklearn.datasets.

Normalized features using StandardScaler.

Split data into training and testing sets.

Implemented KNN using KNeighborsClassifier.

Tested with different values of K.

Evaluated the model using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Visualized the decision boundaries for classification.

ðŸ“Š Results

Best accuracy achieved at K = 5.

Confusion matrix shows correct classification for most samples.

Decision boundaries plotted to visualize classification regions.
